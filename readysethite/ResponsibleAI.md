Responsible AI — Speech-to-Text in Hiring

Bias & fairness

STT accuracy varies by accent, dialect, gender, speech rate, and audio quality; measure Word Error Rate (WER) across diverse speakers.

Do not penalize applicants for transcription errors; allow corrections and human review.

Regularly audit prompts/summaries for biased language; retrain/tune if disparities appear.

Human in the loop

AI summaries are decision support only; hiring decisions require human oversight.

Provide reviewers with raw transcripts + recordings (if retained) to verify context.

Transparency & consent

Clearly disclose recording, STT processing, models used, purpose, and retention.

Obtain explicit consent; provide an opt-out path (e.g., text-only interview).

Privacy & data minimization

Collect the least necessary data; prefer storing text transcripts only.

Define short retention and secure deletion for audio; restrict access via RBAC.

Encrypt in transit and at rest; keep API keys and model calls on the server.

Security

Threat-model the pipeline (upload → processing → storage); log and monitor access.

Validate/scan uploaded media; rate-limit endpoints; protect against prompt injection in downstream LLM steps.

Reliability & error handling

Handle STT failures gracefully (retry/backoff, manual text entry fallback).

Surface clear, non-technical error messages to candidates.

Compliance

Follow local laws (e.g., consent-to-record, anti-discrimination, privacy/APPs/GDPR).

Maintain audit trails for decisions and data processing.

Accessibility — Inclusive Candidate Experience

Alternative input modes

Offer keyboard-only flow and typed responses as a first-class alternative.

Provide captions/live transcript preview and the ability to edit before submission.

Assistive tech compatibility

Ensure WCAG 2.2 AA: focus states, color contrast, semantic HTML, ARIA labels.

Avoid time pressure; allow pausing and resuming recording.

Language & context

Support non-native speakers (clear instructions, slow pace option, glossary).

Allow multiple languages or disclose language constraints upfront.

Environment & hardware

Tolerate low-bandwidth and noisy environments; provide mic test and guidance.

Fair accommodation

Offer disability accommodations proactively and document the process.

Ensure AI outputs do not encode health or disability inferences.

Operational practices

Publish a short RAI policy for candidates and reviewers.

Track metrics (WER by cohort, appeal rates, time-to-hire) and review regularly.

Provide an appeal/correction channel for candidates to contest transcripts or summaries.
